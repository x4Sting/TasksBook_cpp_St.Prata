# TasksBook_cpp_St.Prata
My solution to tasks from the book  -  C++ Primer Plus St. Prata

Task_02_01 - Write a C++ program that displays your name and address (or if you value your
             privacy, a fictitious name and address).

Task_02_02 - Write a C++ program that asks for a distance in furlongs and converts it to yards.
             (One furlong is 220 yards.)

Task_02_03 - Write a C++ program that uses three user-defined functions (counting main() as
             one) and produces the following output:
             
             Three blind mice
             
             Three blind mice
             
             See how they run
             
             See how they run
