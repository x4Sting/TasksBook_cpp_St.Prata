# TasksBook_cpp_St.Prata
My solution to tasks from the book  -  C++ Primer Plus St. Prata

Task_02_01 - Write a C++ program that displays your name and address (or if you value your
privacy, a fictitious name and address).

Task_02_02 - Write a C++ program that asks for a distance in furlongs and converts it to yards.
(One furlong is 220 yards.)
