# TasksBook_cpp_St.Prata
My solution to tasks from the book  -  C++ Primer Plus St. Prata

Task_02_01 - Write a C++ program that displays your name and address (or if you value your privacy, a fictitious name and address).

Task_02_02 - Write a C++ program that asks for a distance in furlongs and converts it to yards. (One furlong is 220 yards.)

Task_02_03 - Write a C++ program that uses three user-defined functions (counting main() as one) and produces the following output:
			 
    Three blind mice
    Three blind mice
    See how they run
    See how they run

Task_02_04 - Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her age.The program then should display the age in months:
             
    Enter your age: 29
    Your age in months is 384
    
Task_02_05 - Write a program that has main() call a user-defined function that takes a Celsius temperature value as an argument and then returns the equivalent Fahrenheit value. The program should request the Celsius value as input from the user and display the result, as shown in the following code:
    
    Please enter a Celsius value: 20
    20 degrees Celsius is 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
    // For reference, here is the formula for making the conversion:
    // Fahrenheit = 1.8 × degrees Celsius + 32.0
    
Task_02_06 - Write a program that has main() call a user-defined function that takes a distance in light years as an argument and then returns the distance in astronomical units. The program should request the light year value as input from the user and display the result, as shown in the following code:
    
    Enter the number of light years: 4.2
    4.2 light years = 265608 astronomical units.
    // 1 light year = 63,240 astronomical units
    
Task_02_07 - Write a program that asks the user to enter an hour value and a minute value.The main() function should then pass these two values to a type void function that displays the two values in the format shown in the following sample run:

    Enter the number of hours: 9
    Enter the number of minutes: 28
    Time: 9:28
